### Overview of NLP
An overview of natural language processing can be found [here](Overview_of_NLP.pdf).
## Assignments
#### Text Processing with Python: [Overview](Text_Processing/Overview_of_Asg_1.pdf), [Code](Text_Processing/textprocessing.py)
This project involves creating a Python script to read through a badly-wrangled set of data on people from a .csv file and clean it up, converting the data into a dictionary of Person objects which store first names, last names, middle initials, IDs, and phone numbers. The program also demonstrates the pickle library by saving the dictionary of Persons to a persons.p file and retrieving it.
#### Exploring NLTK: [PDF](Exploring_NLTK/Asg2.pdf)
In this notebook I used NLTK to analyze its built-in text1, including lemmatization, stemming, and concordance.
#### Guessing Game: [Code](Guessing_Game/guessinggame.py)
This project involves using NLTK to parse a supplied text file to determine the 50 most common nouns. After that, those nouns are used as a list for a hangman or Wheel of Fortune-style game.  
#### WordNet: [PDF](WordNet.pdf)
In this notebook I explored some capabilities of WordNet including synonym sets, sentiment analysis, and collocations.
